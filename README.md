Render a graph of shared files within a nextcloud (18) instance with graphviz.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'nextcloud_share_graph'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install nextcloud_share_graph

## Usage

### Configuration

### Execution

```bash
# magic
```

## Development

## New style

Checkout, run `bundle`, run `bundle console` to interact with the code.

## Old style

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
